MAY 2017 FEWD- CODE Louisville - Final Project

A Website created for the Youtube channel 60secondphilosophy. The aim for this website is to offer a minimalist, yet elegant, design-space
where visitors can access resources for their interests in philosophy and literature. The goal for the finished project is to provide
the site-visitor with a forum, blog, book reviews, store, and a form where they can contribute to the community of philosophers 
by submitting their own questions to be addressed in upcoming Youtube videos. 
At the moment the site is in basic presentation, demonstrating an outline which is focused on the site's nav-bar.

To traverse the site in its current state, begin by opening the index.html.
The viewer will find Javascript elements in the mobile menu, and in the alert on the submission form which can be found 
by clicking "Ask a Question."
